repaint_delay 10
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be
#: processed, repaint_delay is ignored.

input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor no

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.
